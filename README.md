This is my learning codes, I'm still a newbie in programming. Most of them started because I really like to work out on geospatial data. I took a python course for GIS in Lakehead University under the supervision of Tomislav Sapic.

Please refer to the [Assignment 2_Shafa Hadaina.ipynb](https://github.com/shafahadaina/Python/blob/5103966db662745fbfb339d9ea9518c8051e71a2/Assignment%202_Shafa%20Hadaina.ipynb) for the actual implementation of simple analysis using buffer and intersection function in ArcGIS Pro
